# Implementation of Item Listing and Detail View with Ads and Picture in Picture feature
An iOS app demonstrating MVC architecture with item listings, detailed views, and integration of video ads before live content with Picture in Picture feature.

## Features
- Item List: Displays a list of items with name, image, and short description in a table view.
